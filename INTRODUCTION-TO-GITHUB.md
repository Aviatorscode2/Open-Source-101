What is Github
Github is a hosting platform that allows you store, version or track changes and also collaborate on software projects.

Now what Github does is that it is able to track changes made to that project, this is important because you can easily revert to any point a change was made incase there was an error. Github also allows you collaborate on projects, After storing my code on Github, if I made the project repository public, anybody from anywhere in the world can also make contributions to that projects.
